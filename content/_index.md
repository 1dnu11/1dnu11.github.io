# Hello, friend.

Iâ€™m Miguel, a Security Engineer from Portugal. This is my public *Zettelkasten* where I publish notes and, sometimes, full-on rants about stuff that interests me.

Here I share thoughts and learnings about technical topics such as Security, Linux, Cloud, DevOps and many other things that come in my way. You can also expect some posts/writeups of challenges/CTFs.

I don't always run on incognito mode, and you can easily find lot's of information about me around. But if you really want to know more about me, you can [start here](/about).
