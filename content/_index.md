# Hello, friend. ノ ︵ ┻━┻

I’m Miguel, a Security Engineer from Portugal. This is my public [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) where I publish notes and, sometimes, full-on rants about stuff that interests me.

Here I share thoughts and learnings about technical topics such as Security, Linux, Cloud, DevOps and many other things that come in my way. You can also expect some posts/writeups of challenges/CTFs.

Even though it might look like it, I don't live my life in full incognito mode. If you are interested to know more about me, you can simply [check here](/about).
