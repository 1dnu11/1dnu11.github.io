# Hello, friend

Before you question why this blog exists, you can go and read this post [here](https://matthiasott.com/notes/simple-truths-about-personal-websites).

# How to Navigate this Website
To see an index of my entire Zettelkasten sorted in chronological order, visit [Zet](/Zet).

Longer articles can be viewed at the [Blog](/blog) page.

# About This Website
What you are seeing here is the public section of my personal Zettelkasten. I keep a large collection of notes which are stored as markdown files on my harddisk. Whenever I’m studying a topic by reading or watching videos I keep notes about what I learn and store them in my Zettelkasten.

When I want to reflect on a certain topic or to write an article, I go through my collection of notes and link them together. Very often I find that the creation of these links will stimulate even more new connections and associations, and I end up with new ideas for even more topics of study or things that I want to write about. I use my Zettelkasten as a vehicle for reflection, learning and creativity.
