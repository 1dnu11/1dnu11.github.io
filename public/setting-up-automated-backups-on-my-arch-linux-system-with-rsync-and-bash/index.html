<p>For the past few months I&rsquo;ve been stuyding every hour of free time that I had. Now that I reached my certification goals for now, I finally had some time to do a chore I had been meaning to do for a long time.</p>
<p>My Arch Linux system is fully encrypted, and I make backups. But I was still doing it a bit haphazardly, usually every Friday.</p>
<p>I wanted to automate this for a long time now, but I never got round to it. Today I made the first steps, but it is still in progress.</p>
<p>Naturally, I could use a tool like Timeshift or something similar to schedule my backups. However, I want to do it myself using rsync because I want to fully understand what I am backing up, when, and where. Rsync is also used in our environment at work, so I assume it is more common in enterprise and production environments.</p>
<h2 id="full-system-backup">full system backup</h2>
<p>Before I was making a full system backup every Friday using this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>sudo rsync -aAXH --info<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>stats1,progress2 --exclude<span style="color:#f92672">={</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/dev/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/proc/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/sys/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/tmp/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/run/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/mnt/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/media/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/lost+found&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/home/*/.cache/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/data-hdd/&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/games/&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/var/lib/docker/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/home/mischa/music/*&#34;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/swapfile&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/data-hdd2/&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/data-hdd3/&#34;</span><span style="color:#f92672">}</span> / /data-hdd/backups/arch-beast/01-01-23
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command creates a full backup of my entire root filesystem, and it should be possible to restore my entire system by just reversing the target and destination in the end.</p>
<p>However, as I was coming up with my new strategy, I thought this was overkill.</p>
<h2 id="slimming-down">slimming down</h2>
<p>All I really need to back up is my home directory and it would be nice to have my /etc directory backed up as well.</p>
<p>So I wrote a simple shell script to do this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>BACKUPS_DESTINATION<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;/data-hdd/backups/arch-beast&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># format:</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># rsync -a --delete --quiet /path/to/backup /location/of/backup</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"># stop the script if an error occurs</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>set -e
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>rsync -a --delete --quiet --exclude<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;{&#34;</span>/home/*/.cache/*<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;}&#34;</span> /home/mischa $BACKUPS_DESTINATION/home
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>rsync -a --delete --quiet /etc $BACKUPS_DESTINATION
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Made backups on: </span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>date<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span> &gt;&gt; /var/log/backup.log
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>-a flag from man page:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;This  is  equivalent to -rlptgoD.  It is a quick way of saying you want recursion and want to preserve almost everything.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&ndash;delete: means files deleted on the source are to be deleted on the backup as well</p>
<h2 id="automation">automation</h2>
<p>I have a few scripts running in cronjobs on my system. I have a goal of putting them all in systemd timers, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten round to it yet. For now, I will just add my backup scripts to my existing cronjobs setup.</p>
<p>To make my backups every day, I added this to my crontab:</p>
<p><code>0 12 * * * /bin/bash /home/mischa/git/lab/bash/backup</code></p>
<p>Every day it will make a backup to the same directory and update the changed files, or delete the files I deleted from my system.</p>
<p>I also wanted to have a weekly backup happening on Monday.</p>
<p>I will make a more elaborate script to make a weekly directory, and rotate it with a new directory every week. But for now, I just chose a quick solution by creating a weekly version of my script and running it every Monday.</p>
<p>The only difference is the path:</p>
<p><code>BACKUPS_DESTINATION=&quot;/data-hdd/backups/arch-beast/weekly&quot;</code></p>
<p>In the crontab:</p>
<p><code>0 10 * * 1 /bin/bash /home/mischa/git/lab/bash/backup-weekly</code></p>
<h2 id="to-do">to do</h2>
<ul>
<li>set up weekly backup in the same script</li>
<li>create error handling and improve logging</li>
<li>set up in systemd timers instead of crontab</li>
</ul>
